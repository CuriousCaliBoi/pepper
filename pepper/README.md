## Running Pepper

Launch all services (The first time you run this, it'll take a while to build your profile, approximately 1 minute):
```bash
python -m pepper.launch_pepper
```

Open the UI in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5050/pepper/ui.html
```

If you're in the remote server, vscode should be able to port forward the correct port to your local machine automatically.

**Note:** Press Ctrl+C to stop all services.
